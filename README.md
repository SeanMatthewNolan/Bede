# (The Venereable) Bede

> Since I do not want to be thought a thief in putting down as mine what is really theirs, I have decided to place the first letter of each authority in the margin, against each passage taken from his writings.
> I beg and pray that these marks be copied from my original if at some future time my works be judged worthy of reproduction.
> 
> -*St. Bede the Venereable* [1]

## Introduction
(The Venereable) Bede is a document library management tool.
Its goal is to allow orgainization of files through the use of tags.
This avoids the need to heirarchically arrange resources, which may fall within many equally important categories.

The library will also include other functionality helpful in manageing research resources.

Currently, it is in very early developement and not in a functional state.
